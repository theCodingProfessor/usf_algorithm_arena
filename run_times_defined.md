## Algorithm Run Times

A comprehensive list of common algorithm runtimes (time complexities), ordered from fastest to slowest, with a brief explanation of each:

### 1. **Constant Time** — \( O(1) \)
- **Description**: The algorithm takes a constant amount of time, regardless of the size of the input.
- **Example**: Accessing a specific element in an array by index.
  
### 2. **Logarithmic Time** — \( O(\log n) \)
- **Description**: The algorithm’s running time increases logarithmically as the input size increases. It’s very efficient for large inputs.
- **Example**: Binary search, where each step reduces the input size by half.

### 3. **Linear Time** — \( O(n) \)
- **Description**: The running time increases proportionally to the input size. If the input size doubles, the time to complete the task doubles as well.
- **Example**: Traversing through all elements of an array.

### 4. **Linearithmic Time** — \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Description**: The time complexity grows linearly with an additional logarithmic factor. Often seen in efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- **Example**: Merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort (average case).

### 5. **Quadratic Time** — \( O(n^2) \)
- **Description**: The running time increases quadratically with the input size. If the input size doubles, the running time quadruples.
- **Example**: Bubble sort, insertion sort (worst case), selection sort.

### 6. **Cubic Time** — \( O(n^3) \)
- **Description**: The running time increases cubically with the input size. Algorithms with this complexity usually involve multiple nested loops.
- **Example**: Some matrix multiplication algorithms.

### 7. **Polynomial Time** — \( O(n^k) \) (where \( k \) is a constant)
- **Description**: A generalization of quadratic and cubic times, where the growth is proportional to some power \( k \) of the input size.
- **Example**: Algorithms solving problems in graph theory, like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths (\( O(n^3) \)).

### 8. **Exponential Time** — \( O(2^n) \)
- **Description**: The running time doubles with each additional input. These algorithms become infeasible very quickly as the input grows.
- **Example**: Recursive algorithms that solve the Tower of Hanoi, brute force solutions to the traveling salesman problem.

### 9. **Factorial Time** — \( O(n!) \)
- **Description**: The running time grows as the factorial of the input size. These are extremely inefficient and typically only feasible for very small input sizes.
- **Example**: Solving the traveling salesman problem using brute force, generating all permutations of a set.

| **O(n^k)**        | Polynomial (general form)          | Graph algorithms (Floyd-Warshall)     |
| **O(2^n)**        | Exponential                        | Tower of Hanoi, brute force recursion |
| **O(n!)**         | Factorial                          | Brute force permutations, traveling salesman |

### **Other Important Growth Rates**:

1. **Sublinear Time**: \( O(\sqrt{n}) \)
   - **Description**: Some algorithms can be more efficient than linear time for specific operations. For example, certain primality tests run in sublinear time.

2. **Quasilinear Time**: \( O(n \log^2 n) \)
   - **Description**: These are rare, but some algorithms, like advanced versions of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), can fall into this category.

3. **Logarithmic Factorial**: \( O(n \log n!) \)
   - **Description**: Occurs in some combinatorial problems but is less common.

### **How to Use These Complexity Classes:**

- **Constant time** \( O(1) \) algorithms are the most efficient and are ideal for small tasks like accessing or modifying a specific element.
- **Logarithmic time** \( O(\log n) \) algorithms are efficient for large datasets, especially when you can divide the problem into smaller parts (e.g., binary search).
- **Linear time** \( O(n) \) algorithms are standard for tasks that involve looking at every element of an input.
- **Quadratic time** \( O(n^2) \) and higher are often infeasible for large datasets and are usually avoided if more efficient solutions exist.

Knowing these complexities helps developers choose the right algorithm based on the problem size and performance constraints, ensuring the software runs efficiently.
