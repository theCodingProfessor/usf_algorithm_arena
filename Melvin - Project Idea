## PROJECT OVERVIEW - Feel free to either add or make some changes
General Idea : A game design / web page   based study  program involving learning code(python ) for beginners.{cobination of both Sam's and Anna's idea)
includes a levelling based system where players move on to the next level everytime they answer a qauestion correctly.
Certain achievemenst would result in ceratin power ups.

# Things to do
Web Page Creation:
Build a responsive, visually appealing website using HTML/CSS and possibly a front-end framework like React.

Content Development:
Develop Python programming challenges with increasing difficulty (beginner to intermediate levels).
Create short tutorials, hints, and feedback loops for incorrect answers.

Game Design/Model Implementation:
Design a leveling system that tracks user progress and grants power-ups.
Develop a "reward system" for unlocking badges or access to advanced content when achievements are earned.
Optionally include leaderboards to add a competitive element.

Web Page Design & Editing:
Design an engaging UI/UX to encourage learning. 
Add game-like visual elements such as progress bars, icons for achievements, and thematic designs related to coding. 

Final Touches:
Test the web page for bugs, fix any responsive design issues, and optimize for performance.
Add finishing touches like animations, sound effects (for achievements), and other engaging elements.

#Resources we could use
Python: Core language for creating quizzes, coding challenges, and handling backend processes.
GitHub: For version control and collaboration.
Textbooks/Professors: To guide content creation and ensure that the coding challenges follow best practices.
Web Development Tools:
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end website development.
Game Design References: Inspiration for achievements, rewards, and progression systems from gamification sources or simple game design principles.
